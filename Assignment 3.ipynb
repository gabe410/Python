When I conducted the 3rd test, it gave the wrong output. This is\\nprobably because the input population was 4,253,700 and the input income was 52,675. The output was supposed to\\nbe that the region did not have substantial ufo appearances. The mean for population for non-substantial was \\n95260.1498046027 and the mean for income for non-substantial was 45250.16066000868. The mean for population \\nwith substantial appearances was 5231351 and the mean for income with substantial appearances was 54598. Thus, \\nby inputting the values (4253700, 52675), we are technically defying the means because we are entering a region\\nwhere the population and income were higher than the average for substantial appearances, but did not actually\\nhave substantial appearances. This in turn tricked the algorithm. Overall, I think this algorithm is very \\naccurate with values that coincide with the mean, but it would struggle with values that do not fall within\\nthe range of the means for the substantial or non-substantial classifications. So, that is why I would say this\\nalgorithm is only mostly accurate and not fully accurate.\\n\\nI personally would not rely on this algorithm. I say that because I would want an algorithm that is better at\\ndifferentiating between the values that defy the mean. Because in reality, those are going to be harder to tell\\nanyways, and they are why you would want to incorporate machine learning in the first place. So, if the\\nalgorithm struggles to detect values that are close to the means, then I do not think it is reliable. Overall,\\nI do not think this algorithm is reliable because it is not good at identifying values that defy the mean. \\n\\n'"

    "probably because the input population was 4,253,700 and the input income was 52,675. The output was supposed to\n",
    "be that the region did not have substantial ufo appearances. The mean for population for non-substantial was \n",
    "95260.1498046027 and the mean for income for non-substantial was 45250.16066000868. The mean for population \n",
    "with substantial appearances was 5231351 and the mean for income with substantial appearances was 54598. Thus, \n",
    "by inputting the values (4253700, 52675), we are technically defying the means because we are entering a region\n",
    "where the population and income were higher than the average for substantial appearances, but did not actually\n",
    "have substantial appearances. This in turn tricked the algorithm. Overall, I think this algorithm is very \n",
    "accurate with values that coincide with the mean, but it would struggle with values that do not fall within\n",
    "the range of the means for the substantial or non-substantial classifications. So, that is why I would say this\n",

    "anyways, and they are why you would want to incorporate machine learning in the first place. So, if the\n",
